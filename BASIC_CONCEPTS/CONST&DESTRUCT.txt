1️⃣ Constructor
A constructor is a special member function that:

Has the same name as the class.
No return type (not even void).
Runs automatically when an object is created.
Usually used to initialize variables or allocate resources.

Types of Constructors:
Default constructor – no parameters.
Parameterized constructor – takes arguments.
Copy constructor – makes a copy of another object.


2️⃣ Destructor
A destructor:

Same name as the class but prefixed with ~.
No parameters, no return type.
Runs automatically when the object goes out of scope or is deleted.
Used to free resources (close files, release memory, etc.).


note-> destuctor cant be overloaded like constructor, bcs allowed one time
and dont have ay arguments, and can be virtual unlike constructor.

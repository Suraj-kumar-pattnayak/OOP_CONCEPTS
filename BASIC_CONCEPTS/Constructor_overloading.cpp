// Constructor Overloading
// In C++, you can have more than one constructor in the same class. 
// This is called constructor overloading.

// Each constructor must have a different number or type of parameters, so the compiler knows 
// which one to use when you create an object.



class Car {
  public:
    string brand;
    string model;

    Car() {
      brand = "Unknown";
      model = "Unknown";
    }

    Car(string b, string m) {
      brand = b;
      model = m;
    }
};

int main() {
  Car car1;
  Car car2("BMW", "X5");
  Car car3("Ford", "Mustang");

  cout << "Car1: " << car1.brand << " " << car1.model << "\n";
  cout << "Car2: " << car2.brand << " " << car2.model << "\n";
  cout << "Car3: " << car3.brand << " " << car3.model;
  return 0;
}


// Why Use Constructor Overloading?
// To give flexibility when creating objects
// To set default or custom values
// To reduce repetitive code

public - members are accessible from outside the class
private - members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class
protected - members cannot be accessed from outside the class, 
however, they can be accessed in inherited classes.




Note: By default, all members of a class are private if you don't specify an access specifier:

Members declared as protected cannot be accessed from outside the class, but they can be accessed in child classes.
